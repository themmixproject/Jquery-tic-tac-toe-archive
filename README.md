# Personal-Jquery-tic-tac-toe-project-versions-0.1.5-now
this project is mainly meant to back up the previous versions of a tic tac toe game I made this year.
I will create another project with releases of this.

How this started was I saw a small documentary where Bill Gates said his first program was tic tac toe, and so I decided to do the same.
I started out by making just a game board and if you click on a square an "O" would appear within in that square.
If you clicked on another square, an "X" would appear, and so on.
